###### Given that **Python** is a new language, writing a script for Voice Assistant in Python is simple. The assistant's instructions can be customised to meet the needs of the user.
###### *I noticed while working on this project :sweat_smile: that the concept of AI in every industry reduces human effort and saves time.*



#### Functionalities of this project include :relieved: :
* Open and close Camera , cmd,notepad etc :open_file_folder:
* Plays music ( saved in system)
* It returns IP address
* Opens websites like facebook,twitter,stackoverflow etc 	:mag_right:
* Tells joke
* Returns location
* Switches the window
* Downloads instagram profile
* Tells latest top ten news 	:newspaper_roll:
* Does some basic arithmetic calculations	:pencil2:
* Return temperature based on location
* Activates *"how to do mode"* 	:bulb:
* Tells about internet speed
* Informs about the % of laptop battery
* Takes screenshot
* Opens mobile camera :camera_flash:
* Based on the input given, finds meaning, antonym, and synonym 	:100:
* Depending on the input given, immediately searches on youtube :mag:

###### :woman_technologist: Now the fundamental question arises: 
what is an AI? My virtual assistant behaves as if it were not an A.I., but rather the result of a series of statements. However, the primary goal of A.I. machines is to be able to execute human tasks as efficiently as, if not more efficiently than, people.
My virtual assistant is not a particularly good example of A.I., but it is an A.I.

##### The following are the tools and technologies used: 
* [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows)
* In addition, I used the modules and libraries such as [pyttsx3](https://pypi.org/project/pyttsx3/), [SpeechRecognition](https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition/), [Datetime](https://pypi.org/project/DateTime/), [Wikipedia](https://pypi.org/project/wikipedia/), [Smtplib](https://pypi.org/project/secure-smtplib/), [pywhatkit](https://pypi.org/project/pywhatkit/), [pyjokes](https://pypi.org/project/pyjokes/), [pyPDF2](https://pypi.org/project/PyPDF2/), [pyautogui](https://pypi.org/project/PyAutoGUI/), [PyQt5](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/), and other Python libraries.
* I designed a live GUI with [QtDesigner](https://build-system.fman.io/qt-designer-download)for interacting with ALPHA because it gives the dialogue a more design and fascinating look.
