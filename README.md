# Personal_assistant_ALPHA 	:wave:

###### Given that **Python** is a new language, writing a script for Voice Assistant in Python is simple. The assistant's instructions can be customised to meet the needs of the user.
###### *I noticed while working on this project :sweat_smile: that the concept of AI in every industry reduces human effort and saves time.*

###### :woman_technologist: Now the fundamental question arises: 
what is an AI? My virtual assistant behaves as if it were not an A.I., but rather the result of a series of statements. However, the primary goal of A.I. machines is to be able to execute human tasks as efficiently as, if not more efficiently than, people.
My virtual assistant is not a particularly good example of A.I., but it is an A.I.

##### The following are the tools and technologies used: 
* [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows)
* In addition, I used the modules and libraries such as [pyttsx3](https://pypi.org/project/pyttsx3/), [SpeechRecognition](https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition/), [Datetime](https://pypi.org/project/DateTime/), [Wikipedia](https://pypi.org/project/wikipedia/), [Smtplib](https://pypi.org/project/secure-smtplib/), [pywhatkit](https://pypi.org/project/pywhatkit/), [pyjokes](https://pypi.org/project/pyjokes/), [pyPDF2](https://pypi.org/project/PyPDF2/), [pyautogui](https://pypi.org/project/PyAutoGUI/), [PyQt5](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/), and other Python libraries.
* I designed a live GUI with [QtDesigner](https://build-system.fman.io/qt-designer-download)for interacting with ALPHA because it gives the dialogue a more design and fascinating look.

### Contributions 
*This project has a lot of potential. Functionality similar to that of a core AI chatbot can be implemented. There are other python programmes that can be linked. Any such changes will be considered as pull requests. You are welcome to fork this project and make improvements of your own.*
